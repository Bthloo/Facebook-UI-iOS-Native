## Technology Stack

### iOS Native

- **Language**: Swift
- **Frameworks**:
  - UIKit (UI components)
  - URL Session (for network requests and loading images)
  - UserDefaults (for store token)
- **API**: [Dummy JSON API](https://dummyjson.com/)

### API

The app interacts with a dummy RESTful API that mimics the functionalities of a backend, including endpoints for:

- Fetching posts and comments
- Posting new content
- User authentication (fake token-based system)


## Important Notice

All data used in this application is **not real**. The app interacts with a dummy API that simulates the process of creating, updating, and deleting data, but **no actual changes are made to the server**.

- **Adding a new post**, comment, or user will only simulate the process locally; no data is stored or sent to the server.
- Similarly, **deleting or editing posts or comments** will simulate the action but will not affect any actual data on the server.

The primary purpose of this app is to demonstrate functionality without altering any real backend data.
